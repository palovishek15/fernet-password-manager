# üîê Fernet Password Manager

A lightweight **Password Manager** in Python designed to **use my daily activity** while keeping passwords secure.  
This project uses the `cryptography` library (Fernet) to encrypt passwords, supports multiple-account entry flows, and includes features to view and delete stored credentials.

## Project Overview
This is a learning-oriented password manager that allows you to:  

- Encrypt and store passwords securely using **Fernet symmetric encryption**.  
- Manage multiple accounts in one run (multi-input flow).  
- View stored credentials (account & username).  
- Retrieve decrypted passwords when needed.  
- Delete specific credentials safely.

---

## Features
- Add multiple accounts at once.  
- Supports both **number** or **name** input for social/account selection:
  - LinkedIn, X/Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Gmail, Snapchat.  
- Securely encrypt passwords before saving.  
- Interactive CLI for adding, viewing, and deleting credentials.  
- Encrypted vault file (`passwords.txt`) with separate encryption key (`key.key`).  

---

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3  
- **Libraries:** 
  - `cryptography` (Fernet encryption)
  - `os` & `getpass` (system & hidden input handling)

## Quick Start (Kali Linux)
Copy-paste these commands to set up the project:

bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/palovishek15/fernet-password-manager.git
cd fernet-password-manager

# 2. Create a Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install cryptography

# 4. Generate encryption key (run once)
python3 key.py

# 5. Run the multi-account manager
python3 password_manager_multi.py

# 6. View stored credentials
python3 view_vault.py

# 7. Delete an entry (interactive)
python3 delete_entry.py
Commands & Usage Examples
Add multiple accounts

python3 password_manager_multi.py
Prompts: How many accounts do you want to store?

For each account: select by number (e.g., 4) or name (gmail).

Enter username/email and password (hidden), confirm password.

View decrypted credentials

python3 view_vault.py
Example output:

graphql
Copy code
001 | gmail      | me@example.com               | myS3cretP@ssw0rd
002 | facebook   | user123                      | anotherPass123
Delete a credential

python3 delete_entry.py
Lists entries with numbers.

Prompts for entry number to delete and confirmation.

Data Storage & Vault
Vault file: passwords.txt

Each line format:

Copy code
account_name|username|FERNET_TOKEN_BASE64
Encryption key file: key.key

Example line:

gmail|me@example.com|gAAAAABlZQ... (long base64 token)
Security Recommendations
Do not commit key.key or passwords.txt to Git. Add to .gitignore:


key.key
passwords.txt
Restrict file permissions:


chmod 600 key.key
chmod 600 passwords.txt
chmod 700 ~/Documents/password_manager
Use non-root user on Kali Linux.

Consider master password + KDF (Argon2/scrypt) for stronger security.

Encrypt usernames too if sensitive.

For secure deletion, use shred instead of simple file rewrite:

shred -u passwords.txt
Avoid leaving passwords in clipboard.

Next Steps
Move from file-based storage to encrypted SQLite (SQLCipher).

Add GUI using Tkinter or PySimpleGUI.

Implement master-password authentication with Argon2.

Add unit tests for add/view/delete flows.

Contributing
Fork the repo, add features or improvements, submit a pull request.

Never push key.key or passwords.txt in PRs.
